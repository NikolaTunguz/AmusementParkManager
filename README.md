## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to show proficiency with:
1.	**Refactoring code**;
2.  **Abstract base classes**;
3.  **Template Functions**;
4.  **Template Classes**;
5.  **Dynamic Memory**;

## HOW TO RUN
First, compile the code by running the command "make". An executable will be made called "carnivalComplete". Run the code by calling the executable followed by providing the filename on the command line when running (./carnivalComplete patronList.txt). 

The program loads existing patron data (see patronList.txt for format). If the file can be opened for reading, each patron should be read from the patron file. The program should display a menu for modifying options. The overall program will run a carnival from the eyes of patrons. Each patron will be able to buy tickets and go on rides.

The program should calculate ticket cost and output that cost so that the patron can be charged. The user can input a number of tickets to add to a patron, calculate the total cost of those new tickets, and input the amount of money handed to them by the patron, and then calculate and display the amount of change that the user should hand off to the patron.
